# TensorFlow.js Learning Repository

## 1. Introduction
This is the TensorFlow.js repository where I share my daily learnings and progress in TensorFlow.js. The goal of this repository is to document my journey as I explore and master the capabilities of TensorFlow.js, while also sharing insights, challenges, and useful code examples.

## 2. What is TensorFlow.js?
TensorFlow.js is an open-source library developed by Google for running machine learning models and deep learning neural networks in the browser or on Node.js. By using JavaScript, TensorFlow.js makes it possible to develop, train, and deploy machine learning models directly in web applications or server-side applications. This allows for powerful and interactive machine learning experiences that can run on a wide range of devices without needing a separate backend server.

## 3. Use of TensorFlow.js
TensorFlow.js enables developers to build and train machine learning models directly in the browser or in Node.js using JavaScript. It provides a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in machine learning and developers easily build and deploy machine learning-powered applications. Some common use cases include:

- Real-time data processing and analysis
- Interactive machine learning models in web applications
- Training models in the browser using data directly from the user
- Deployment of pre-trained models for tasks such as image recognition, text analysis, and more

## 4. History
TensorFlow.js was originally launched in March 2018 as deeplearn.js, an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for machine intelligence. It was later integrated into the TensorFlow ecosystem and rebranded as TensorFlow.js. Since then, it has grown rapidly and is now a core part of TensorFlow's suite of machine learning tools, enabling the use of machine learning on the web and in JavaScript environments.
